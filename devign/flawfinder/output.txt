FINAL RESULTS:

./data/20.c:5:  [5] (race) chmod:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchmod( ) instead.
./data/2099.c:143:  [5] (race) chmod:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchmod( ) instead.
./data/2099.c:149:  [5] (race) chown:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchown( ) instead.
./data/2099.c:589:  [5] (race) readlink:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files or
  change the link content, a race condition results. Also, it does not
  terminate with ASCII NUL. (CWE-362, CWE-20). Reconsider approach.
./data/2099.c:1351:  [5] (race) chown:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchown( ) instead.
./data/990.c:597:  [5] (race) chmod:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchmod( ) instead.
./data/990.c:2089:  [5] (race) readlink:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files or
  change the link content, a race condition results. Also, it does not
  terminate with ASCII NUL. (CWE-362, CWE-20). Reconsider approach.
./data/990.c:4437:  [5] (race) chown:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchown( ) instead.
./data/990.c:5015:  [5] (race) chown:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchown( ) instead.
./data/1027.c:43:  [4] (format) snprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited,
  and note that sprintf variations do not always \0-terminate (CWE-134). Use
  a constant for the format specification.
./data/1029.c:331:  [4] (format) fprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited
  (CWE-134). Use a constant for the format specification.
./data/1085.c:83:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).
./data/1198.c:15:  [4] (buffer) sscanf:
  The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits
  buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20). Specify a limit to %s, or use a
  different input function. If the scanf format is influenceable by an
  attacker, it's exploitable.

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
