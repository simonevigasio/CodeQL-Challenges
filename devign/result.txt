FINAL RESULTS:

data/0-683/20.c:5:  [5] (race) chmod:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchmod( ) instead.
data/1367-2731/2099.c:143:  [5] (race) chmod:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchmod( ) instead.
data/1367-2731/2099.c:149:  [5] (race) chown:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchown( ) instead.
data/1367-2731/2099.c:589:  [5] (race) readlink:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files or
  change the link content, a race condition results. Also, it does not
  terminate with ASCII NUL. (CWE-362, CWE-20). Reconsider approach.
data/1367-2731/2099.c:1351:  [5] (race) chown:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchown( ) instead.
data/684-1365/990.c:597:  [5] (race) chmod:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a

  change the link content, a race condition results. Also, it does not
  terminate with ASCII NUL. (CWE-362, CWE-20). Reconsider approach.
data/684-1365/990.c:4437:  [5] (race) chown:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchown( ) instead.
data/684-1365/990.c:5015:  [5] (race) chown:

  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchown( ) instead.
data/0-683/217.c:31:  [4] (format) vsprintf:
  Potential format string problem (CWE-134). Make format string constant.
data/0-683/220.c:9:  [4] (race) access:
  This usually indicates a security flaw. If an attacker can change anything
  along the path between the call to access() and the file's actual use
  (e.g., by moving files), the attacker can exploit the race condition
  (CWE-362/CWE-367!). Set up the correct permissions (e.g., using setuid())
  and try to open the file directly.
data/0-683/220.c:45:  [4] (buffer) sscanf:
  The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits
  buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20). Specify a limit to %s, or use a
  different input function. If the scanf format is influenceable by an
  attacker, it's exploitable.
data/0-683/220.c:47:  [4] (race) access:
  This usually indicates a security flaw. If an attacker can change anything
  along the path between the call to access() and the file's actual use

  (CWE-362/CWE-367!). Set up the correct permissions (e.g., using setuid())

  and try to open the file directly.
data/0-683/249.c:11:  [4] (format) snprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited,
  and note that sprintf variations do not always \0-terminate (CWE-134). Use
  a constant for the format specification.
data/0-683/257.c:273:  [4] (shell) popen:

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
