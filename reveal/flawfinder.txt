FINAL RESULTS:

data/1706-2273/2071.cpp:17:  [5] (race) chmod:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchmod( ) instead.
data/0-568/333.cpp:4:  [4] (buffer) sscanf:
  The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits
  buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20). Specify a limit to %s, or use a
  different input function. If the scanf format is influenceable by an
  attacker, it's exploitable.
data/0-568/450.cpp:167:  [4] (format) syslog:
  If syslog's format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be
  exploited (CWE-134). Use a constant format string for syslog.
data/0-568/450.cpp:194:  [4] (format) syslog:
  If syslog's format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be
  exploited (CWE-134). Use a constant format string for syslog.
data/0-568/490.cpp:20:  [4] (shell) execlp:
  This causes a new program to execute and is difficult to use safely
  (CWE-78). try using a library call that implements the same functionality
  if available.
data/0-568/55.cpp:19:  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination [MS-banned]
  (CWE-120). Consider using snprintf, strcpy_s, or strlcpy (warning: strncpy
  easily misused).
data/0-568/551.cpp:16:  [4] (format) snprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited,
  and note that sprintf variations do not always \0-terminate (CWE-134). Use
  a constant for the format specification.
data/0-568/66.cpp:142:  [4] (format) snprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited,
  and note that sprintf variations do not always \0-terminate (CWE-134). Use
  a constant for the format specification.
data/0-568/66.cpp:244:  [4] (format) snprintf:
  If format strings can be influenced by an attacker, they can be exploited,
  and note that sprintf variations do not always \0-terminate (CWE-134). Use
  a constant for the format specification.
data/1137-1705/1260.cpp:190:  [4] (buffer) sscanf:

  different input function.
data/1137-1705/1260.cpp:300:  [4] (buffer) sscanf:
  The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification, permits
  buffer overflows (CWE-120, CWE-20). Specify a limit to %s, or use a
  different input function.
data/1137-1705/1268.cpp:12:  [4] (race) access:
  This usually indicates a security flaw. If an attacker can change anything
  along the path between the call to access() and the file's actual use
  (e.g., by moving files), the attacker can exploit the race condition
  (CWE-362/CWE-367!). Set up the correct permissions (e.g., using setuid())
  and try to open the file directly.
data/1137-1705/1269.cpp:7:  [4] (format) vsnprintf:

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
